    "details": "An economic analysis published by Hasnat, a prominent economist, has raised concerns over the increasing national debt of Bangladesh. The report highlights the potential risks associated with the country's growing debt burden and calls for more prudent fiscal management. Hasnat's analysis has sparked discussions among economists, policymakers, and the public about the long-term sustainability of the nation's economic policies.

However, the report has fueled debates about the need for greater transparency and accountability in public spending and the importance of addressing the national debt to safeguard the country's economic future.",
